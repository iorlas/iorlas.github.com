 The SQL standard is defined by four levels of transaction isolation basically regarding three phenomena. The three phenomenon must be prevented between concurrent transactions. The unwanted phenomena are:

- **Phantom read:** A transaction that re-executes a query, returning a set of rows that satisfy a search condition and then finds that the set of rows that have been satisfying the condition has changed due to another recently-committed transaction.
- **Non-repeatable read:** A transaction that re-reads the data that it has previously read and then finds that data has already been modified by another transaction (that committed since the initial read).
- **Dirty read :** A transaction when reads data that is written by a concurrent uncommitted transaction is the dirty read.
