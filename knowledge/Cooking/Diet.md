I’ve read most of them. There be dragons. There’s an entire landscape of conflicting information backed by conflicting scientific studies. You’ll go mad trying to find an objective answer.

But I’d recommend Food Rules by Michael Pollan. Honestly, you can get the summary in the first paragraph below: “Eat [real, unprocessed] food. Not too much. Mostly plants.”

I’d also recommend anything by Dr. Rhonda Patrick. I feel like she does not have an agenda and is putting out best-effort evidence.

Multiple mentions of "How not to Die" by Dr. Michael Greger which is great and extensively researched - and he just came out with a new book "How not to Diet" which looks like the same quality.

Also, if you like videos better, there is a huge collection by him on https://nutritionfacts.org/ - searchable by condition (like "cholesterol"), or on his youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/NutritionFactsOrg

Spoiler alert: all of his conclusions boil down to just a few things:

\- don't drink calories

\- eat less processed food

\- eat less meat and dairy

\- eat more fiber (beans, greens, fruits, veggies)
