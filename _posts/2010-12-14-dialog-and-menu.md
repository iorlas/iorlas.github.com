[Dialog and Menu](http://dialogmenu.appspot.com/) is my experimental project. Since I am studying Theory of Computation this semester, I am interested in Finite State Machines and other related ideas.

The ultimate objective of this project is hosting a Turing machine webapp on Google App Engine so that people can play with it and add interesting machines for others to play.

Currently, there is only FSM functionality in it. But you can make interactive novel and simple game with it. Try the Tic-Tac-Toe game that I made for 2 hours!

But please bear with my poor knowledge of web interface. Traditional HTML forms is all I got. Strings and buttons are also handled in an ancient way.
